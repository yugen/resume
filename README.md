# Resume for Jack W Ward III, Full Stack Developer

Hi, I'm Jack, but please call me TJ.  I've been banging away, making custom web-based applications for about 20 years, now.  This repo is my resume.  It's literally just some HTML and Javascript, but it looks pretty good and I can always print-to-pdf.

I may or may not currently be looking for a new job.  Chances are I'm happy where I'm at, but it's always good to keep the resume polished.

If I were looking for a new opportunity, it'd probably be with an organization that does something worthwhile for the world, has interesting problems to solve, and values people who work hard.

<!-- I don't do social media.  I don't think it's good for most people and it's definitely not good for me. -->

## Q&A
### Eew, full stack?  Yuck!
I came up when in a time when Javascript hosted on a mega-corp's platform couldn't solve all your problems. I keep doing it this way because:
1. I'm highly skeptical of the walled garden platform-as-a-service.  I like my work to be portable so if one platform/host starts to get meglomaniacle I can pick up and go somewhere else.
2. It's what I know and I have yet to find an employer that wants to go serverless.

### Why would someone build their resume using HTML and CSS?  
Becuase I'm pretty good at web standards, I'm terrible at MS Word, and I don't have time to learn LaTeX.
